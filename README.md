Video Colorization using Pix2Pix GAN Model

This project is dedicated to the task of colorizing black and white videos through the application of the Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. By harnessing the capabilities of deep learning, our implementation offers an effective solution for revitalizing monochromatic videos, thereby enriching their visual appeal and reviving historical footage.

Key Features:

Pix2Pix GAN Model: Our project employs the Pix2Pix architecture, a type of conditional GAN, to learn the intricate mapping between black and white frames and their corresponding colorized counterparts. This sophisticated framework ensures that the colorization process is carried out with precision and fidelity.

Video Processing Pipeline: We have designed a robust pipeline that efficiently processes input videos, frame by frame. At each step, our model applies intricate colorization transformations, leveraging the learned patterns and structures from the training data. This ensures a seamless and coherent transition from grayscale to full color, resulting in visually stunning outputs.

Customizable Parameters: To cater to diverse use cases and preferences, our implementation offers extensive flexibility in parameter tuning. Users have the ability to adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture, empowering them to fine-tune the model according to their specific requirements and constraints.

High-Quality Results: One of the hallmarks of our project is its ability to produce high-fidelity colorized videos. We prioritize attention to detail and strive to preserve the original characteristics of the input footage throughout the colorization process. This commitment to quality ensures that the resulting videos are not only visually appealing but also authentic and true to their original context.
